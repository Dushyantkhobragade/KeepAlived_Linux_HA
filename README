Keepalived acts as HA to keep website available even if one of the backend web servers go down.

In this scenario, configured 2 nginx server with Keepalive floating IP.

Server1: 192.168.207.160 (CentOS 7)
Server2: 192.168.207.162 (CentOS 7)

Keepalive floating IP: 192.168.207.159

# Steps to setup Keepalived: Below steps needs to performed on both servers.

1. Install keepalived-x.x.x-x.el7.x86_64 available in CentOS Base 7 repo.

2. Configure sysctl.conf with below kernel paramters. I created file /etc/sysctl.d/keepalived.conf for keepalive configuration.
    net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300
    net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 60
    net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 20
    net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
    
3. Create the track script "/etc/keepalived/keepalived_check.sh". This script should have executable permission. Look for the file keepalived_check.sh in this git repo.

4. Create keepalived.conf (/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf). Look for the keepalived.conf file in this repo.
Note: Parameters to focus on in this file are state, interface,priority.
      - state: which server you want to make Master and Backup
      - interface: based on your server interface.
      - piority:  Master server always has higher Priority (255) and backup server (254)
      
5. Install Webserver Nginx (or whichever your prefered). In this scenario, nginx used.
6. Enable and start nginx service. Check if nginx is listening on port 80.
7. Once confirmed, enable and start the keepalived service.
8. check floating IP , it should be available on master server. Try to access nginx with floating IP.
9. To validate if keepalived working properly, stop keepalived service on master node and see if floating IP is moving to backup node. IP movement should happend quickly. Again try to access nginx with floating IP.
10. Logs can be seen in /var/log/messages
